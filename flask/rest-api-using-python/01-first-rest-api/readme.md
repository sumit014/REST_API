## This is the first rest api build using flask in python. 

- We have used Flask to developed REST API.
- Created endpoints for the resource URL.
- Endpoints creation script is in app.py

## Installation of Flask
`` pip install flask``

## Run Flask app
`` flask run ``
- Local host URL will start listing to the flask app.
- Then we can start using the endpoints defined in the code.

## API Testing
- We can use any approach to test the APIs(Pthon requests module, curl command or API testing application like Postman or Insomnia)
- I have used Insomnia for this project.(Since I have already used Postman so thought of using Insomnia)
- Download link for Insomnia: https://insomnia.rest
- Attached the colelction of requests used for this project.
